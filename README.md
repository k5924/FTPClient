# FTPClient

## Introduction

This is an FTP client built using python. I have made it somewhat modular by allowing a user to change specific parameters in order to connect to a specific FTP server

## Usage

This is to be used with a remote FTP server. Enter the details via cli. To quit the program hit CTRL+C
